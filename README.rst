What is C2?
-----------
C2 is a relatively young programming language based on C. 

Here is the developers' take on the language:
        
        Philosophy:

        "The C programming language has been around for a long time and is still used a lot nowadays. 
        The core of the language is very solid, but other aspects are showing their age. 
        C2 attempts to modernize these parts, while keeping the feel of C. 
        It should be seen as an evolution of C."
